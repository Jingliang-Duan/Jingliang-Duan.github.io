Brief Biography
======
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am currently a tenured Associate Professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Science and Technology Beijing. I am affiliated with the Department of Automotive Engineering.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before joining USTB, I served as a research fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lzhao">Prof. Lin Zhao</a>, from 2021 to 2022. I received a B.S. degree in automotive engineering at the College of Automotive Engineering, Jilin University, in 2015. From 2018 to 2019, I studied as a visiting student researcher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, under the supervision of <a href="https://me.berkeley.edu/people/francesco-borrelli/">Prof. Francesco Borrelli</a>. In Jan. 2021, I received the DPhil (Ph.D.) degree in Mechanical Engineering from the School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/dpeople.html?8">Prof. Bo Cheng</a> and <a href="http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/dpeople.html?11">Prof. Shengbo Eben Li</a>. I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning, optimal control, adaptive dynamic programming, and their applications to autonomous vehicles and robotics.
